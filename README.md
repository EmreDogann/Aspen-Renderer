# Aspen Renderer (WIP)

Apsen is a cross-platform 3D renderer written in Vulkan.

The objective of this project is to explore the Vulkan API and learn more about the underlying graphics hardware and pipeline systems in place to perform rasterization and ray tracing (on more recent GPUs) rendering.

The project mainly follows the work of [Brendan Galea's Vulkan Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9U9IE0gVHA&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR). However, this series is used as a rough guide and more work is done on this engine external to that series in order to fit my needs.

Currently, this is not intended to be an engine but just a graphics renderer using rasterization (and ray tracing as a future goal). However, in the future, that priority could change as the project evolves.
